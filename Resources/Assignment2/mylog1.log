hello
world
this is logging at the top level
  using indent, you can indent to organize your logs
  try-resource pattern automatically outdents after you are done
  this won't be discarded
  it's true!
    you can also nest an indent
    like this!
back to the top level!
and let's print the logs
log was just cleared
so you start logging from the top level again
